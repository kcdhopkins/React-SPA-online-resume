                    about: "Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity was founded at Howard University in Washington, D.C., January 9, 1914, by three young African-American male students. The Founders deeply wished to create an organization that viewed itself as “a part of” the general community rather than “apart from” the general community. They believed that each potential member should be judged by his own merits, rather than his family background or affluence…without regard to race, nationality, skin tone or texture of hair. From its inception, the Founders also conceived Phi Beta Sigma as a mechanism to deliver services to the general community."

Used toad for MySQL to connect to local databases to monitor data changes, create tables, and to run any query needed to assist in development and debugging. All Java Development was done in the Integrated Development Environment Eclipse, using an apache local webserver. These tools were used to meet a specific set of requirements set forth by the customer. After local development and successful completion of developer testing, IT testing and functional user testing, all work would be presented to the IT Security team for their review. Once complete, the completed work would be presented before the board to receive a “Push to Production” approval. If approved, all code would be staged to the Liferay portal in the production environment. Used styling languages, such as CSS to enhance the overall look, and feel of webpages, used minor functionality such as “hover &quot;to provide a user-friendly experience. Worked heavily in JavaScript to manipulate data on the client side to prevent page refreshes, as well as make changes to the DOM when data changes through event listeners and callbacks. Worked extensively in ServiceNow to recreate older applications that were initially created using other languages, such as Java, .NET and ColdFusion; as well as set up silo’s, tables and advanced custom forms that required modifications to the “out of the box” features of ServiceNow."
